# OMDB Application

This simple app takes a user input search and returns a result from the Open Movie Database.

# Approach
- First, defined the problem: we need to implement an application which takes user input and returns a result from an API call.
- Before coding, wrote down what tests I will implement to make this application work as intended.
Tests include
  1: Testing the API and making sure it returns the expected data, or error if there is one
  2: Making sure the app renders correctly

# Writing the code
- Implemented basic react component boilerplate structure to take input and display search results.
- Implemented an API service file which we call when the user searches for a movie title
- Implemented styling using the styled components library. This technology is new to me, but I can already see how useful it is proving to be even from this simple implementation
- Transcribed the tests I had thought of already into code, and made sure the app worked as intended.

# How I would improve this app
- If I refactored this, I would first start out by implementing the tests I had come up with before writing any code. In this case, I first wanted to become aquainted with the new styling library before I wrote tests using the testing library, as I thought that using styled components may change the way I am used to writing my tests.
- If I spent a lot of time on this app, I would refactor the styling to be more fun. I had an idea of a 'magic 8 ball' / 'crystal ball' theme for the application which I think would be fun, but given the short amount of time spent on this application I decided to keep it very simple!
